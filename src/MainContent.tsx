  <h1>About</h1>
  <hr/> 
  <p>At NextGen, we firmly grasp the truth that coding is more than just a necessary skill in today's swiftly evolving digital environment; it's the foundation for the innovation that propels us forward. With the rapid rate at which technology is advancing, the knowledge and proficiency in programming have become the bedrock for pioneering digital solutions, fostering creativity, and driving societal growth.
<br/>
<br/>
However, we recognize that the traditional ways of learning coding often fall short in terms of their effectiveness. Traditional pedagogical methods are frequently a one-size-fits-all, ignoring the individual strengths and weaknesses of the learner. This issue is magnified in the field of programming, where hands-on practice is paramount, and the speed of comprehension can significantly vary among learners. The current methods often fail to offer an environment where learners can practice, experiment, and learn from their mistakes in real-time.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the conventional methods tend to be low on interaction, missing out on the power of collaborative learning and community support. Many learners find themselves isolated, with little to no opportunities for collaboration, peer-to-peer learning, or networking. They are often devoid of the chance to work on shared projects, participate in code reviews, or engage in constructive discussions, thereby missing out on vital aspects of a comprehensive coding education.
